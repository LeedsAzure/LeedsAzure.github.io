## Welcome to #LeedsAzure

This site contains important information around what LeedsAzure is all about.

We are a User Group community that is focused on all things Azure & is based in Leeds.

We were founded in January 2020, with an aim to bring to Leeds a thriving in-person Azure User Group community, & then Covid hit which haltered plans to bring in person events, though we did run a few virtual events between April 2020 & July 2020.

We are planning a series of topics for 2021 & intend to run at least 1 group each month, starting with virtual events in early January, and moving to Hybrid Events (in person but accessible virtually too) as it is deemed safe to do so.

You can find us over on the [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/LeedsAzure/)  
You can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeedsAzure)

### What can you expect from the LeedsAzure User Group

We run like a typical user group with a variety of different ways that we can be interacted with

We will commit to run at least 12 events across the 2021 calendar year consisting of either
- Evening User Groups
    -  Typically consisting of 1 or 2 presented sessions per group
- Lunch and Learns
    - Short easily digestible topic overviews


We may also decided to run a number of the following types of events
-  Trainer lead workshops
    - Free or Low Cost (Just enough to cover any venue hire & food costs)
- Weekday & Weekend Events
    - Free or Low Cost (Just enough to cover any venue hire & food costs)
